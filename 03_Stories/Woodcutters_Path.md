# Chapter 1 – The First Split

**Scene 1 – Morning Interruptions**  
- The boy, age ten, is about to bolt out the door to play with friends.  
- His mother gently stops him: *“Your father would like to see you before you run off.”*  
- The boy sighs, impatient but curious.  

**Scene 2 – The Father’s Lesson**  
- His father is in the yard, finishing sawing a log into manageable rounds.  
- He calls his son over and introduces the axe.  
- Demonstrates the proper grip, stance, and swing—how to use the body, not just the arms.  
- Gives a few examples, corrects the boy’s sloppy first attempts.  
- Leaves him with fatherly advice: *“With practice, you’ll find your own rhythm. Don’t rush. The wood will teach you.”*  
- Then the father heads back to process more trees, leaving the boy to it.  

**Scene 3 – The First Struggle**  
- The axe feels awkward and heavy in the boy’s hands.  
- He misses his mark, glances blows off the edges, rarely splits clean.  
- He grows frustrated but also starts to notice a strange *enjoyment* in the rhythm of swing-reset-try again.  
- Still, his mind keeps wandering to the laughter of his friends somewhere in the distance.  
- After about an hour of work, his father nods approval and lets him go play.  

**Scene 4 – Return at Dusk**  
- The boy spends the day running wild with the other children, forgetting his chore.  
- Coming home at dusk, he spots the axe leaning against the stump where he left it.  
- On impulse, he picks it up and gives a few practice swings, mimicking his father’s lesson.  
- He plants his feet, grips tight, and brings it down hard.  
- *CRACK!* The log splits cleanly in half.  

**Scene 5 – The Ding**  
- For a heartbeat he just stares at the perfect split.  
- Then… *Ding!*  
  **[Skill Acquired: Woodcutting Lv.1]**  
- The chapter closes on his wide-eyed wonder.
