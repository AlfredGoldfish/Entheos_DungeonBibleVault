# Essence of the Dungeon

- **Nature:** A living organism spanning dimensions.  
- **Body:** Rooms, floors, tunnels = cells, veins, organs.  
- **Growth:** Expands fractally, tendrils piercing realities.  
- **Feeding:** Consumes death, bloodshed, destruction.  
- **Intelligence:** Distributed, alien awareness. Not a single mind, but acts with eerie intent.  

## Open Questions
- Does it have a purpose beyond feeding?  
- Can it be killed, starved, or infected?  
- Do any beings *truly* understand it?
