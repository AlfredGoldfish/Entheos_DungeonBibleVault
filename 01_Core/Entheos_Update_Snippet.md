### Time & Pressure Systems
Entheos sustains itself through unique manipulation of **time** and **magical pressure**:

- Main body resides in void-space, away from dense gravity wells → time tends to flow faster inside Entheos.  
- Tentacle appendages reach into denser worlds → portals form, creating **time gradients**.  
- Time dilation ratios are not exact — usually ~10:1, but vary depending on world connections.  
- Entheos maintains magical pressure balances, like atmospheres, to sustain native life.  
- Beings adapted to Entheos cannot survive elsewhere without catastrophic imbalance.
