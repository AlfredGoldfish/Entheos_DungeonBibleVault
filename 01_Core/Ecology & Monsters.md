# Ecology & Monsters

The Dungeon’s body spawns lifeforms to regulate itself.

- **Monsters = White Blood Cells** (immune system).  
- **Loot = Bait** (artifacts, magic, ore).  
- **Hubs = Symbiotic Organs** (civilizations tolerated as gut flora).  

## Monster Design Prompts
- What ecosystem do they mimic?  
- Are they native to the Dungeon or assimilated from consumed worlds?  
- Do they evolve when prey adapts?  

## Open Questions
- Can monsters escape and live independently?  
- Do “bosses” represent parts of the Dungeon’s anatomy?
