# Assimilation Cycle

The Dungeon consumes entire worlds in stages:

1. **Breach** – First portal appears.  
2. **Infusion** – Mana/energy leaks, physics and magic shift.  
3. **Merging** – Terrain warps, dungeon-biomes spread.  
4. **Full Consumption** – World absorbed into Dungeon matter.  
5. **Rebirth** – Civilizations reappear only as ruins, monsters, or treasure.  

## Notes
- Resistance only delays consumption.  
- Dungeon “hubs” believe they are safe, but they are tolerated only to attract prey.  

## Open Questions
- How long can a world survive after breach?  
- What are examples of worlds at each stage?
