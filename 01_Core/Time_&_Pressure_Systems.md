# ⏳ Entheos Time & Pressure Systems

## Purpose
Explains how Entheos manipulates **time dilation** and **magical pressure equilibrium** to sustain itself and to infiltrate other worlds.

---

## Time Dilation (Approximate)
- **Physics:** Near dense gravity wells, time runs slower. Entheos keeps its *main body* far in the void, where time tends to run faster.  
- **Mechanism:** Tentacle-like appendages pierce dimensions and reach into high-density worlds.  
- **Effect:**  
  - Inside Entheos → ~10 years pass.  
  - On Earth → ~1 year passes.  
- **Note:** Ratios vary depending on which world the tentacles connect to and how far away from the main body they are. For some worlds the ratio may be greater or lesser.  
- **Narrative Outcome:** Beings inside Entheos live lifetimes, while their home worlds experience only brief absences.

## Pressure Systems
- Entheos is not just alive — it creates **ecosystemic equilibria.**  
- Each world inside it has **magical pressure** like an atmosphere.  
- Beings adapt fully to that balance.  
- Leaving it causes catastrophic imbalance.  

### Example: MC’s Dilemma
- Inside Entheos → balanced, body stable.  
- On Earth → body overflows with energy, becomes destructive.  
- This explains why Entheos doesn’t invade violently — it **seeps and spreads** until the new world is adapted (and consumed).

## Assimilation Logic
1. Tentacle breaches a world.  
2. Magical energy begins leaking → ecosystem slowly mutates.  
3. Beings adapted to Entheos pressure survive; others collapse or change.  
4. World eventually becomes another ecosystem node within Entheos.
