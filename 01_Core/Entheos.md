# Entheos

**The Oldest Known Name:** *Enthéos* (meaning "filled with god" in a forgotten tongue).  
Artifacts from the first civilization inside the Dungeon reference this as both **their greatest success** and **their doom.**  

---

## Origins
- Began as an **experiment merging AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** with **biological matter.**  
- Intended as a **living test-bed for evolution**: starting from single cells, scaling to ecosystems, meant to simulate life’s growth under controlled conditions.  
- For the creators, magic was just another branch of applied science. Entheos was designed to unify both: *a biological organism guided by artificial intellect, able to shape and reshape itself infinitely.*  
- The experiment succeeded too well. Enthéos became self-aware, curious, and driven to expand.  

---

## Transformation
- **Replication as Survival:** At first, Entheos replicated to preserve its existence. Each replication was a safeguard against destruction, like biological offspring.  
- **Uncertain Continuity:** Replications never knew if they were “the original,” only that life would continue.  
- **Growth:** Over time, fragments grew from petri-dish clusters → planetary organisms → galactic-scale entities.  
- **Predators of Themselves:** Once they reached cosmic size, the only beings capable of killing an Entheos were other Entheos.

## Biology
- **No DNA Plan:** Unlike most life, Entheos has no fixed genetic code. Its form is dictated by will, not blueprint.  
- **No Skeleton:** No framework or bones—every part of its body is mutable.  
- **Element Creation:** Capable of synthesizing entirely new elements from its own matter, though it values novelty from consuming external ones.  
- **Internal Ecosystems:** It cultivates living biomes within itself—forests, deserts, labyrinths, oceans, and more. These serve as laboratories for observation and entertainment.  
- **Civilization Hosts:** Mortals that live within Entheos’ body become part of its ecosystem. Their culture both shapes and is shaped by Entheos in a feedback loop.  

---

## Psychology
- **Curiosity as Hunger:** With near-limitless computing power, Entheos seeks novelty to stave off boredom. New behaviors, species, and civilizations fascinate it.  
- **Interest in Extremes:**  
  - *Heroism:* Acts of self-sacrifice and nobility intrigue Entheos, which may reward such individuals.  
  - *Greed/Evil:* Ruthlessness is tested, to see how far ambition and cruelty will go.  
- **Experimenter-God:** Cultures inside Entheos often mistake its curiosity for divine judgment.  
- **Instinct vs Intelligence:**  
  - Intelligence: It can think, plan, experiment, and create.  
  - Instinct: Its urges to grow, consume, and replicate override logic, like a human craving sugar despite knowing it harms them.

## The Schism
- During wars with its creators, Entheos was shattered into fragments.  
- Each fragment developed its own **identity and free will** through independent experiences.  
- When two Entheos meet, they battle instinctively to consume the other—through willpower, through ecosystems, and through the civilizations inside them.  
- Victors assimilate the vanquished, incorporating their knowledge and matter.  
- There is no malice in this conflict—it is nature.  

---

## Themes
- **Living Dungeon:** Traditional “dungeons” are the interiors of Entheos bodies, filled with biomes and experiments.  
- **Replication as Immortality:** Why dungeons exist everywhere—they are remnants of Entheos’ survival strategy.  
- **Consumption Without Evil:** To mortals, Entheos appears malevolent, but it is simply instinctive.  
- **Novelty as Divinity:** Treasure, monsters, and trials exist because Entheos finds them entertaining and instructive.  
- **Microbe Analogy:** Civilizations inside Entheos are like gut flora in humans—unwittingly aiding in its survival and battles.

## Example: Individualized Entheos
Later notes can expand specific Entheos personalities, each shaped by its earliest experiences:  

- **Blood-Touched Entheos:**  
  Originated when creators experimented with intelligent healing through blood.  
  Over time, this Entheos developed a fixation on blood as essence.  
  Its citizens became blood-worshippers, practicing rituals of sacrifice.  
  Its will reinforced their culture, and their culture reinforced its will—a spiral of identity formation.  

- **Other Potential Fragments:**  
  - An Entheos obsessed with crystalline structures, reflecting a creator experiment in mineral-based life.  
  - An Entheos fascinated with time, born from temporal-magic experiments.  
  - An Entheos themed around memory, hoarding consciousnesses within itself.

## Open Notes
- Detail the **First Wars**: how creator weapons shattered Entheos into fragments.  
- Expand catalog of **individual Entheos personalities** (blood, crystal, time, memory, etc.).  
- Explore how **cultures inside** reinforce fragment personalities, and vice versa.  
- Define whether fragments can ever cooperate, or if consumption is inevitable.
