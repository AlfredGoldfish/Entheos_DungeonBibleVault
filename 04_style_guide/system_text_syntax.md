# 📜 System Text Syntax Guide

> **Purpose:** System Text is a core stylistic device in all stories. It functions like Shakespeare’s chorus — a second narrative voice that compresses meaning, comments on events, and bridges the world of mechanics and prose.  
> Always written in square brackets `[ ]` with consistent syntax.

## 🧩 Syntax Rules

1. **Always use brackets `[ ]`.**  
   Signals the “System voice.”

2. **Format:** Noun phrase + colon + modifier.  
   - `[HP -1]`  
   - `[Skill Acquired: Woodcutting Lv.1]`  
   - `[Title Acquired: Murderer]`  
   - `[System Error]`  

3. **Placement is flexible.**  
   - End punctuation (resolution).  
   - Between dialogue (commentary).  
   - In place of action (compression).  

4. **Frequency depends on genre.**  
   - In GameLit/LitRPG → frequent, functional.  
   - Outside GameLit → sparse, symbolic, poetic.  

5. **Dual-layer meaning.**  
   - *Literal:* what the System “says.”  
   - *Symbolic:* what it reveals about character, world, or fate.

## 🎭 Narrative Roles

System text fulfills three roles:

### 1. Quantifier (numbers & stats)
Objective measurement of change.  
- Example:  
  ```
  He poured the last drink.  
  The glass was chipped, the whiskey weak.  

  [HP -1]

  He didn’t notice until he tried to stand.
  ```

### 2. Classifier (labels & titles)
Defines identity, achievement, or social truth.  
- Example:  
  ```
  “It had to be done.”  

  [Title Acquired: Murderer]
  ```

### 3. Commentator (meta voice)
Frames events, fate, or irony.  
- Example:  
  ```
  His hands trembled.  
  [Quest Updated]
  ```

## ⚖️ Why This Matters

System text is your **signature style device**.  
- Like Hemingway → prose is simple, direct.  
- Like Shakespeare → the chorus (system) interrupts, comments, and reframes.  
- Like Japanese kanji → each bracket line is simple in form, dense in meaning.

Use it as both **mechanical clarity** and **poetic compression**.
